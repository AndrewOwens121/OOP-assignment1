# OOP-assignment1
##Student Number : C143636341 

For my First OOP assignment I was given a task to create a UI for a Sci-fi movie device , 
which had lots of animation and interactivity and should include 
*Variables, loops, methods
*Arrays & array lists
*Objects, inheritance, polymorphism
*The unit circle and trigonometry
*pushMatrix, popMatrix, translate and rotate

###Variables, loops, methods
I used Variable , loops and Methods thoughout my code to minimise hard-coding , and to make my code as efficient , readable , and Reusable as possible

###Arrays & array lists
I used Arrays & arrayLists thoughout my code to store and pass back values , store toggles(boolean arrays) , and store instances of my class

###Objects, inheritance, polymorphism
I used Objects in my Assignment to have an easy template in which to store data taken in from a .csv file , the use of class's helped with making my program scalable from 1 Ship to 100,
Although I didnt get around to inheritance or Polymorphism as we havent touched these topics in class even though I do have a brief understanding of these Programming concepts , 
I didnt have a case where I could do a worth-while implementation of these concepts without just shoe-horning them in , So I decided not to include them in my assignment.

###The unit circle and trigonometry
I Used the Unit Circle and trigonometry in my code to help the sonar with ship detection , which ended up working perfectly.

###pushMatrix, popMatrix, translate and rotate
I used these methods as the backbone of my sonar method and without these built-in processing methods It would have taken me alot more code to get the Sonar method up and running.

##Feature
The feature I am most proud of in this assignment is the radar and using the guidelines of the assignment to implement all of its functionality,
as you can see below the only ships that light up on the radar , are those within the scope of the radar , I implemented this feature using co-ordinate geometry, trigonometry, and the Unit circle.
